# EzPartyEzLife
Hackagong weekend 

I built this app concept(for now) at the hackagong competition, the general idea is as follows
1. you have a party your organisising and your trying to get people to chip in some money to help you.
2. you have a facebook event with all the poeple comming
3. you go to the app and login with your facebook and then the app adds people from the event to pay into the pot that goes towards the party
4. everyones payed and you recieve the money and you then make the party happen.


things to add later
1. payout options
2. party packages
3. delivery options straight to the party host.
4. re do the ui.
